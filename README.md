# student-developer-reporting-demo
demo idea for DSI

## Reporting idea

Want to try to characterize and generate summary reports of student developer activity across projects.

### Approaches

1. Have student developer have an Issue on the student developer reporting project that is updated with a running list of Issues and PRs on projects they are working on.

2. Use the GitHub API through [`ghapi`](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi) to be able to follow the creation of Issues and PRs for targeted repos. Can create a dashboard website through GHA and GitHub Pages.
